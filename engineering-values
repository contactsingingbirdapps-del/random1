# How We Build Software
This document explains how we think about engineering.
It exists so that people who work with us know what to expect.
If this resonates with you, we’ll probably work well together.
If it doesn’t, that’s completely okay.

## Our Philosophy
We optimize for:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Long-term maintainability over short-term speed
- Boring, reliable solutions
We believe good software is:
- Easy to read
- Easy to change
- Hard to break accidentally

## How We Design Systems
- Start simple, then evolve
- Prefer fewer abstractions
- Avoid premature optimization
- Design for the next change, not the last one

## How We Review Code
When reviewing pull requests, we focus on:
- Can someone new understand this in 6 months?
- Are names clear and intentional?
- Is complexity justified?
- Is the behavior obvious?
We don’t nitpick formatting.
We do care deeply about reasoning.

## Speed vs Quality

- We move fast early
- We slow down where mistakes are costly
- We refactor when learning changes the design

## What Good Code Looks Like to Us

- Small, focused functions
- Clear boundaries
- Explicit trade-offs
- Honest comments (why, not what)

## What Bad Code Looks Like to Us
- Over-engineering
- Copy-paste without understanding
- Magic behavior without explanation
- Code that only the author understands

## Final Note
We don’t expect perfection.
We value thoughtful builders who care about the craft.
